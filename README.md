# Astro + TypeScript Project with ESLint and Prettier Configuration

This repository contains ESLint and Prettier configurations tailored for an Astro project using TypeScript. ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with rules that can help enforce coding styles and best practices. Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code formatting in your project.

## Getting Started

To use these configurations in your Astro project, follow these steps:

1. Install ESLint, Prettier, and related plugins as development dependencies in your project:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser
    ```

2. Copy the `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc.json` files from this repository into the root of your project.

3. Optionally, you can add npm scripts to your `package.json` for linting and formatting:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts",
     "format": "prettier --write ."
   }
   ```

4. Run ESLint and Prettier:

   ```bash
   npm run lint # For linting
   npm run format # For formatting
   ```

5. Integrate ESLint and Prettier with your code editor. This step is optional but recommended for real-time linting and formatting.

## Configuration Files

### `.eslintrc.json`

This file contains the ESLint configuration for TypeScript projects using Astro. It extends the recommended ESLint configurations for TypeScript and adds some specific rules for Astro projects. Feel free to modify this file according to your project requirements.

### `.prettierrc.json`

This file contains the Prettier configuration. Prettier is configured to work seamlessly with ESLint using the `eslint-config-prettier` and `eslint-plugin-prettier` packages. You can customize these settings to match your preferred code style.
